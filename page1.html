    <h1>1.1 - What is the importance of IT in modern bussines</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="para1">
    <p>The purpose of IT in modern business is to enhance the business reach by promoting them to the biggest platform on the planet, the internet. The efficiency of the business improves as is cheaper to advertise on the internet, the cost of advertisement on television, newspaper and radio are much higher. Social media enables businesses to advertise at no cost but with lower scale reach, paid advisement on social media have unlimited reach. This is a much more advance way of promoting business as the advertisement can be constantly promoted where as in Tv, radio or newspaper can only be done for a short amount of time in the Tv or radio or in a small segment of the newspaper. Online advertisement has higher sales as it reaches national and international customers.
        Online shopping is more efficient than shopping in a store. The facility of buying products from the comfort of your home has an immense value to people who are unable to go the store for multiple reason such as: Long distance, not selling the product in your country, health problems and disabilities. The internet allows customers to search online for a product, purchase through online banking and get it delivered to any address they want, get instant customer support.
        Innovation increase productivity as technology helps business do repetitive tasks in mass productions, which means products are made quicker. 
        Innovation helps business with real time monitoring of sales, prices, and the effectivity of improvements with customer reviews.<a href="#section1">[1]</a>

        <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
        <br>
        <div class="para2">
        <p>A digital project requires knowledge in software programs that are more efficient for the specific task, this knowledge can be obtain through IT courses, personal research or by sharing information between colleges. The equipment is primordial when making a project having a decent hardware like a laptop or a Pc that runs smoothly, having software programs like VSCODE that is capable of running different programming languages such as html and CSS to create a website, python to program technologies. Making use of planning and monitoring apps that allows you to share ideas and progress with colleges, such as Trello, slack and GitHub.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board. </h3>
        <br>
        <div class="para3">
        <p>The chances of making a great project increases massively when having a set of goals and objectives, is very important to have them sorted in order to have the task done clearly and not miss any important points. Trello is an app that’s design to help you create a product roadmap, this a tool used to create <a href="#section2">[2]</a> a high-level graphical overview of the goals and deliverables such as reports, documents and software products. The roadmap is design using the Kanban method to implement agile software development, it is used to manage the work process, visualize the work, limit working progress and maximize efficiency<a href="#section3">[3]</a>  by using a Kanban board. 
            The way Kanban board work is by having project ideas and placing them in a timeline referred them as tasks, that are placed inside columns that indicate whether the task needs to be done, is doing and is done. Based on tasks the process it will be moved from to column to column until is completed.
            Here is the Link to my Trello board.

            1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
        </h4>
        <br>
        <div class="para4">
        <p>The two major factors that causes digital projects to fail are Technology error and human error theses two factors are always found when making a digital project, these are the causes for both:
            Technology Error
            Bad internet access: Routers are the source of internet and can be connected either by cable or Wi-fi. The cable connection can be disrupted by a faulty cable or a faulty pc or router internet socket. The Wi-fi connection can be disrupted by moving to an area away from the router and losing signal. This results in losing un-saved data due to no connection with an app or website.  
            System crash: A system crash is referred to a computer that stops working, the reasons crashes happen are software or hardware failure. The computer is unusable either because its “frozen” (still powered on, but not responsive) or is turned off and will not operate. A system crash mixed with the human error of not saving any work results in the work being lost.<a href="#section4">[4]</a>
            Low memory: this happens when the memory limit of the computer is exceeded, when trying to save data or opening a program, a memory full message alert displays because the virtual and random-access memory is full. Make sure the computer has enough memory to run properly.
            Human Error
            Short term priorities taking over: Not spending the required amount of time on the project because of other priorities is very common, not having an organized time table in which you assign what to do throughout the day is probably the main fail factor.
            The initial scope was poorly defined: Not having a clear idea on how to make the digital project and starting it is a big step to failure. Not taking the effort to create a clear plan and idea results in failure.
            Trying to do too much work all at once: Not being organized in doing a task and finishing it before starting another one delays your progress as there isn’t an exact priority to accomplish. 
            Not being trained enough: Doing a task without the knowledge necessary. Before starting the project do the proper training and learning.

        <h5>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?  </h5>
        <br>
        <div class="para5">
        <p>The working environment is a big factor on selecting the right kind of technology, if the work place involves traveling you will need light equipment easy to carry around like a laptop or tablet, if is in a fixed location like an office a PC will be more convenient. In your time off ideas or solutions can be written on your phone or tablet, apps like slack or Trello are useful to send them to colleges.
            Depending on the task different Its systems and software need to be selected, if the product is interactive like an app or game the VSCODE software has python and other similar programming languages to use. If is designing a website html and CSS are the most common.

            1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
        </h6>
        <br>
        <div class="para6">
        <p>Make note of GitHub you can’t talk about GitHub just yet and trello we know how to use when to use trello has helped me in doing…
            You don’t need a reference for all but from the webpages researched put a link at the end as a reference
            Trello has help me plan by separating my work into task that I ca focus on one at the time, remanding me what is left to do.

            1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
        </h7>
        <br>
        <div class="para7">
        <p>GDPR stands for The General Protection Regulation (2018) and is a European data protection law, its purpose is to give EU individuals know as data subjects more control over how their personal data is processed a range of new obligations on organisations that process and control the processing of personal data. Their personal data consist on information that can be used to identify a living person such as, names, location data, email address, health records, photos etc. Failing to comply with the GDPR’s requirements will leave organisation open to considerable higher penalties than they face under the 1998 Data Protection Act, with maximum fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater.
            The new law promotes greater transparency, accountability and aims to increase public trust by giving individual more control over their data.
            <br><br>There are six data processing principles that organisations must demonstrate compliance with:<br>
            <ol><br>
            <li>Processed lawfully fairly and in a transparent manner.</li><br>
            <li>Collected for specified explicit and legitimate purposes.</li><br>
            <li>Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary.</li><br>
            <li>Accurate and where necessary kept up to date.</li><br>
            <li>Retained only for as long as necessary.</li><br>
            <li>Processed in an appropriate manner to maintain security.</li><br></ol><br>
            
            There are six lawful bases for processing data:
            <ol><br>
            <li>Contractual obligations</li><br>
            <li>Comply with the data controllers’ legal obligations.</li><br>
            <li>Protect the data subjects’ vital interest</li><br>
            <li>For task in the public interest or exercise of authority by the data controller</li><br>
            <li>For purposes of legitimate interests’ pursuit by the data controller</li><br>
            <li>If the data subject gives their explicit consent <a href="#section5">[5]</a></li></ol><br>
            The impact GDPR has on digital projects is positive one as it sets boundaries to protect the privacy and identity of the costumers, specially with online sales being more common, costumers must have the security of using their bank details without a threat of someone stealing them without being prosecuted by the justice system.
