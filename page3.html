        3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?         </h13>

        <div class="para13">
        <p>The benefits of the It tools used to make the website are the cost factor as it was completely free to use VSCODE and Trello are free to download from the web. The number of tutorials you can find online are more than enough to give you guidance and help you add your own creativity to it. The simplicity of the names used on html to call a paragraph or a title "p" and "h" and to rename them with class= … was very efficient on saving time trying to learn a syntax. 
        The drawbacks of the IT tools where the amount of memory VSCODE uses make the computer slower and consumes more time because of the constant freeze, having to advent measurements by pixels was quite difficult to do as it’s a measurement unit not used in the physical world. </p>

            One of the ways of improving productivity is by learning more through courses that will tech you more advance techniques, these courses can be done online and depending on the cost, duration and content your productivity and efficacy will improve drastically. Another way to improve is sending a good amount of time practicing what you learned and trying to improve any previous work by researching online for new solutions.

            3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
        </h15>
        <br>
        <div class="para15">
        <p>
            Some of the ways to improve productivity on VSCODE is by using the extension features to customize and achieve simpler ways of working with the programs, another way of improving is by creating one yourself if you can’t find an extension that achieves what you are looking for.
            Using themes to add some colorization in order to read the code much easier. You can also add the auto formatting setting to automatically clean up the code from worn indentation, wrapping text on new lines, adding semicolons, etc. this will save a lot of time. VS code also gives the option to customize shortcuts to save time and effort in making changes or navigating through your code.
            Using the help of GitHub to share codes the work in team would have been more organized, I would distribute work to each individual through Trello and keep track of everyone’s progress.
            Using the help of GitHub to share codes the work in team would have been more organized, I would distribute work to each individual through Trello and keep track of everyone’s progress and Slack and Zoom to communicate with the team mates in private groups.

            To test digital solution, I would have looked online for examples of extensions that will achieve what I’m looking for, read through the tutorials to understand how they work and practice with a simple code the efficiency of the extension. To test Trello, I would of look for examples of different ways it was used for and apply ideas from the example that fits to the type of work I’m doing.
