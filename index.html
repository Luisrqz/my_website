Starting with consoles PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 Gameboys etc. and desktops Pcâ€™s. My millennial technology environment gave me a passion for the tech world and I decided to get a career involving technology. After I finished my career, I wanted to learn more abut programming languages so I sign up for a course at code nation where I learned to use Python, Slack, Trello, visual studio code, HTML, CSS and GitHub. During the process of the course my interest in having a career in IT increased because of the immense creativity you have put into planning, designing and creating a product that can tech you so much about the potential humans have in converting an idea into a product. therefore the role of Technical consultant is a role that I am aiming for as a career choise. On this Blog I will to talk about the IT industry and my expirience working with IT programs. On the unit pages I answered a set of quetions related to the IT industry and my expirience with the programs.</p>
