        <h8>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h8>

        <p>
            The tools I have used for my digital project are very useful and efficient, Visual Studio Code is very complete tool for programming, it has html and CSS installed so you can do both languages in one app. The app layout is easy to understand and manage with navigation bars on the top and left side of the app, which are the first places the eyes checks. The terminal is displayed at the button of the same page. The error messages are displayed on the terminal and the code with a red line under the error line, this make coding much easier as not much time is wasted looking for an error in the code.
            Trello is very simple to use as you can choose from a variety of layouts designs and choose the one fits best. The cards are simple to make just need to add a title and is optional if you add description, write a comment on activity r add members, labels, checklist, due date, attachment, cover.

            2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello 
        </h9>
        <br>
        <div class="para9">
        <p>
            The IT tools selected to the project were appropriate because the allowed me to complete all the required tasks. Trello helped me by organizing my work with the Kanban method and keep track all of the work process. Visual studio code provides a platform to create and program a website using html and CSS programing language. Slack helped me keep in contact with my tutor and colleagues, this help me ask for support, provide course materials like tutorials and the project specifications.

            2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?

        <div class="para10">
            The website I created has an attractive design as I used colors and a background that matched electronic components, which at first glance gives a visual representation that the website is related to IT. In terms of written text, the navigation bar needs to be explained on the home page as the term “Unit 1: outcome 1” wasn’t defined on the website. home page titles describe the website as a blog that is about my digital project, this is useful information for a title. After the title I added a paragraph about me and that where it ends, I didn’t include anymore images on this pages so I think an image or two would of given the page a much more lucid look, so I will include at least an image related to the about me paragraph.  On the other pages I have the same issue so I will include an image for each paragraph. Overall, I’m content with the way my website looks as it’s well organized and has a lucid design.

        </h11>
        <br>
        <div class="para11">
            Improvement that I would add to my website are reaction and comment section below each section of the website to make the website more interactive and collect positive criticism from the readers, I would have used an Instagram like format with likes, comments and shares interactions. I would of a page to show my work portfolio with the best of my achievements to prove my knowledge.

        </h12>
        <br>
        <div class="para12">
        <p>The quality of the information used is genuine as I have researched from websites that which information can’t be change by anyone, just by professional its technicians, the outcomes that requested my own opinion are all answered honestly review my own mistakes and strengths at the initial plans. </p>
