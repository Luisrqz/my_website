        <p>
            All of the pages have that same background which is an image of human head shape drawn with electronic circuits and binary numbers which reflects the website’s contact. On the top left side of the website I put a logo of my initials to give a sense work done by me. The navigation bar has the short cut of the six pages, it’s the same turquoise color of the background’s image and the logo so it blends well to the website’s layout.
            The home page title describes the website as a blog about my digital project. Followed by an about me paragraph that explain my relation with IT systems and what I will be talking about on my blog.
            On the Unit 1, Outcome 1 I describe the use of appropriate IT systems and software to meet the needs of the IT project, by doing this I will set a portfolio to show my abilities and knowledge as a consultant
            On the Unit 1, Outcome 2 I critically reviewed my website by talking about my use of IT tools and systems to get the activities correct and successful.
            On the Unit 1, Outcome 3 I describe ways to improve the IT tools systems used to make my website.7
            On the Unit 2, Outcome 1 I describe the different structures and styles for a webpage.

        <p>
            The copyright law in the U.K. is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 that protects original creations involving literary work, music, art, film, and sound.  When creating a website, the copyright law protects as soon as is crated because they contain creative elements like written content and images. However, the U.K. Copyright Service highly recommends registration because websites are subject to abuse and that process allows a civil cause of action. To remind users of this protection, many websites add copyright notice to the footer. New content on a website requires addition registration, that is why a range of years are added to cover all past and current content.
            To register the first thing need is to check the data base to be sure that similar content is not already registered, fill out the application, pay for the fee and wait for the decision of the copyright office.<a href="#section6">[6]</a>
            Making a copy and selling a protected copyright work can result in penalties such as:
            <ul>
            <li>li>Before a magistrates' Court, the penalties for distributing unauthorised files are a maximum fine of £5,000 and/or six months imprisonment;</li>
            <li>On indictment (in the Crown Court) some offences may attract an unlimited fine and up to 10 years imprisonment.<a href="#section7">[7]</a></li></ul>

        <p>
            The issues that people with disables may face when using webpages are:
            If the person is blind, he/she won’t be able to read anything on the screen as images don’t have alt text, some complex images are not well described into text or audio, videos that are not described in text or audio, lack of keyboard support for all commands. Most individual who are blind rely on screen readers which are software’s that read text displayed on the screen. Low vision individuals have the issue to find websites with small text frame and when zoom in the text, they are difficult to navigate when enlarged, due to loss of surrounding context. To fix those having a good size font on anything written.
            If the person’s deaf they have the difficulty of having many audios and videos without captions, this can be fixed by having automated captions in every videos.
            A person that have mobility problems struggles with typing, so instead of typing they could use a voice recognition.
            A person with learning disabilities may experience lack of alternative modalities for information on Web sites, for instance lack of alternative text that can be converted to audio to supplement visuals, or the lack of captions for audio, distracting visual or audio elements that cannot easily be turned off, lack of clear and consistent organization of Web sites.<a href="#section8">[8]</a>

        <p>
            As there are many different file formats to choose from, we have selected the four we think work best on the web: a JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF, all of which contain a lossy or lossless compression. A lossy compression means images lose information and quality once the file size decreases whereas a lossless compression does not lose any detail when the file size is changed.<a href="#section9">[9]</a>
